# diffusion_model_co2_absorption
Model of the chemical process for absorption of gaseous co2 using a solution of CaO in a CaCl2 solution using a learned diffusion model.  This is a relatively simple dynamical system which is used to sample from the PDE governing the chemical reactions.  These samples are the input to the ML learning of the diffusion model.
